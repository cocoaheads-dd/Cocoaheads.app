#Cocoaheads.app Modules

#App starts
- Read access to all (public) information is immediately granted
- There is an alphabetic list of countries and their Cocoaheads chapters --> Basically a table with sections
- At first, this table is empty and will be filled after chapter admins enter the respective data
- Who does this data entering anyway? How to avoid double entries? What about deletions etc?
- Selecting a chapter brings up a detail page about it
- The user can choose a home/favorite chapter that has a special place in the chapter overview and can optionally be preselected when the app starts

	- Name, picture (logo), map/location of regular meeting place, location as text, button to route there
