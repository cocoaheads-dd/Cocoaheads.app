# Cocoaheads.app

Here are some initial thoughts about this wonderful future app: :arrow_right: [Thoughts.md](Thoughts/Thoughts.md)

Please, read them first, then go on and help, if you want to. It's considered help as well to simply expand on the Thoughts document. Or to provide sketches or links to inspirational apps. Anything goes.

Update March, 21 2016:
We held a little planning session where we discussed the specifics of what the app should basically be like. The results of which are now translated to English and uploaded.  See [Modules en.md](Thoughts/Modules en.md)
